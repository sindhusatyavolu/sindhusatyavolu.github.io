Abstract:

Measurements of the mean free path of Lyman-continuum photons in the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization
can help constrain the nature of the sources as well as sinks of hydrogen-ionizing radiation. A recent approach to this measurement
has been to utilize composite spectra of multiple quasars at 𝑧 ∼ 6, and infer the mean free path after correcting the spectra for
the presence of quasar proximity zones. This has revealed not only a steep drop in the mean free path from 𝑧 = 5 to 𝑧 = 6, but
also potentially a mild tension with reionization simulations. We critically examine such direct measurements of the mean free
path for biases due to quasar environment, incomplete reionization, and quasar proximity zones. Using cosmological radiative
transfer simulations of reionization combined with one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations of quasar proximity zones,
we find that the bias in the mean free path due to overdensities around quasars is minimal at 𝑧 ∼ 6. Patchiness of reionization
at this redshift also does not affect the measurements significantly. Fitting our model to the data results in a mean free path of
𝜆mfp = 0.90+0.66 pMpc at 𝑧 = 6, which is consistent with the recent measurements in the literature, indicating robustness with −0.40
respect to the modelling of quasar proximity zones. We also compare various ways in which the mean free path has been defined in simulations before the end of reionization. Overall, our finding is that recent measurements of the mean free path appear to be robust relative to several sources of potential bias.
