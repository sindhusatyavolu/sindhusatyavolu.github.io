Hi! My full name is Sindhu Sri Sravya Satyavolu. I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cosmo-Lya](https://cosmolya.ifae.es/) group at the [Institut de FÃ­sica d'Altes Energes](https://www.ifae.es/) (IFAE), Barcelona. I completed my PhD under the guidance of [Prof. Girish Kulkarni](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~kulkarni/) in the Department of Theoretical Physics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. Prior to that, I studied engineering in the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.
