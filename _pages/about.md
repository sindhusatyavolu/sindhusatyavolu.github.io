My full name is Sindhu Sri Sravya Satyavolu. I'm a PhD student working with [Prof. Girish Kulkarni](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~kulkarni/) in the Department of Theoretical Physics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. I previously studied engineering in the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.

My current research interests are in the study of quasars in the high-redshift universe, with the aim of understanding reionization and super massive black hole growth.
