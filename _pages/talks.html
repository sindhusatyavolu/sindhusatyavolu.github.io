Hi, my full name is Sindhu Sri Sravya Satyavolu. I'm a PhD student working with [Prof. Girish Kulkarni](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~kulkarni/) in the Department of Theoretical Physics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai. I previously studied engineering in the Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.					

Research in Extragalactic Astrophysics and Cosmology
======
Quasars are the brightest astrophysical sources in the Universe, powered by supermassive black holes. Several quasars have been observed as far as ~13 billion years back in time, having central supermassive black holes billion times more massive than the Sun. These quasars also act as a backlight, allowing us to look through the intergalactic medium between us and the quasar. That being so, how did supermassive black holes grow so massive within only a billion years after Big Bang? What can we learn about the intergalactic medium from quasars? 
I mainly use simulations to model quasar spectra at the end of the reionisation epoch to probe answers to the above questions.
